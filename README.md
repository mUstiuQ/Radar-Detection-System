### 📌 About the Project
This project is a radar system designed using an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and microcontroller to detect objects, measure their distance, and visualize the data in real time.
The system simulates how actual radar technology works by continuously scanning its surroundings and displaying the results graphically.

#Key Features

✅ Object Detection & Distance Measurement – Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and calculate their distance accurately.

✅ Real-Time Scanning – The servo motor rotates the sensor to scan the environment, mimicking a real radar system.

✅ Graphical Visualization – Data is displayed in a radar-like interface, providing a clear view of detected objects.

✅ Adjustable Range – Users can modify the scanning angle and detection range to fit different environments.

✅ Compact & Cost-Effective – Designed to be an affordable, educational tool for learning about radar systems and embedded programming.


### 🛠️ Components Used

✅ 1x Arduino UNO

✅ 1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

✅ 1x MG90S Servo Motor

✅ Breadboard & Jumper Wires

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Install Arduino IDE

2️⃣ Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram

3️⃣ Upload the [(arduino_code)] code to Arduino

4️⃣ Run the Processing script for visualization from [(preocessing_code)] 

### 🚀 How It Works
🔹 The ultrasonic sensor sends pulses and measures distances.

🔹 The servo motor rotates the sensor to scan the area.

🔹 Data is sent to a display or Processing for visualization.

🔹 If an object is detected, a signal can be triggered.
